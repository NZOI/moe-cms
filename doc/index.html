<h1>The Moe Contest Environment</h1>

<p>The Moe Contest Environment (formerly MO-Eval) is a system for conducting
programming competitions similar in spirit to the
<a href="http://www.ioinformatics.org/">International Olympiad in Informatics</a> &ndash;
contestants solve programming tasks, submit the source code of their solutions,
which is then automatically tested on a set of test inputs.

<p>Moe is built in a modular way, making it easy to adapt it to the specifics
of a particular contest, to other types of tasks, or other programming languages.

<p>A brief description of the system and of the ideas behind it can be found in the following two papers
published in <a href="http://www.i-journals.org/olympiads_in_informatics/">Olympiads in Informatics</a>:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://mj.ucw.cz/papers/eval.pdf">Perspectives on automatic grading systems</a>
<li><a href="http://mj.ucw.cz/papers/eval2.pdf">Moe &ndash; Design of a Modular Grading System</a>
</ul>

<h2>Contests</h2>

<p>Moe (or some of its modules) are used at the following contests:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://mo.mff.cuni.cz/p/index.html.en">Czech Olympiad in programming</a> since 2002
<li><a href="http://mo.mff.cuni.cz/cpspc/">CPSPC</a> (Czech-Polish-Slovak Preparation Camp) on some years
<li><a href="http://www.fi.muni.cz/ceoi/">CEOI 2007</a> (Central-European Olympiad in Informatics)
<li><a href="http://www.ioi2009.org/">IOI 2009<a> (used the sandbox module)
<li><a href="http://codex2.ms.mff.cuni.cz/project/">CodEx</a> (a web-based system, originally
	designed for evaluation of students' homeworks, but also used for several programming
	contests)
</ul>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>Moe is still under heavy development, so the best way to obtain the latest
version is directly from our <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> repository at git://git.ucw.cz/eval.git.
The master branch of the repository is kept in a stable state, new development
is done on other branches and then merged to the master.

<p>We also occasionally publish snapshot tarballs in our <a href="ftp://ftp.ucw.cz/pub/mj/eval/">FTP archive</a>.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Warning: Most parts of this documentation are outdated. Please consult the papers above
to get a more up-to-date picture.

<li><a href="eval.html">Evaluating solutions</a>
<li><a href="public.html">Utilities for contestants</a>
</ul>

<h2>Portability</h2>

<p>The environment runs under Linux on the i386 architecture. We currently use
a slightly modified installation of <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian
GNU/Linux</a>, but it will happily work with any other Linux distribution with
a 2.6 or newer kernel. The only dependecies on Linux and on i386 are in the
sandbox module; porting to other architectures requires just minor changes,
porting to other UNIX systems is probably hard. Outside of that, everything
should run happily on almost any system providing a reasonable set of GNU
utilities (especially bash) and Perl, possibly including MinGW or Cygwin on
Windows.

<h2>Authors</h2>

<p>Moe has been written by the following people:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://mj.ucw.cz/">Martin Mares</a>
<li>Tomas Gavenciak (the queue manager module)
</ul>

<p>We are also thankful to Jan Kara and Milan Straka for their help and for
many fine ideas.
