<h1>The MO Contest Environment</h1>

<p>The MO Contest Environment a.k.a. MO-Eval is a simple system for conducting programming competitions similar to the
<a href="http://olympiads.win.tue.nl/ioi/">International Olympiad in Informatics</a> &ndash; a contest
where the participants solve programming tasks, which are then evaluated off-line after the end of the
competition. It's built in a modular way, so extending to other types of programming contests
(e.g., to on-line contests like the <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/">ACM ICPC</a>) should be
pretty easy, but it hasn't been done yet.

<p>We use this environment at the <a href="http://mo.mff.cuni.cz/p/index.html.en">Czech Olympiad in programming</a>
(officially a part of the Mathematical Olympiad) since 2002 and also at the <a href="http://mo.mff.cuni.cz/cpspc/">CPSPC</a>
(Czech-Polish-Slovak Preparation Camp) when it's held in the Czech Republic.

<h2>Portability</h2>

<p>The environment runs under Linux on the i386 architecture. We currently use a slightly modified installation of <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian
GNU/Linux</a>, but it will happily work with any other Linux distribution with a 2.4 or newer kernel. The only dependecies
on Linux and on i386 are in the sandbox module; porting to other architectures requires just minor changes, porting to other
UNIX systems is probably hard. Outside of that, everything should run happily on almost any system providing a reasonable
set of GNU utilities (especially bash) and Perl. Porting to Windows is probably out of question.
