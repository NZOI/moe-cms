New directory layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mop/ and public/ are broken

Evaluator
~~~~~~~~~
score: better formatting of the score table
interactive tasks: solve deadlocks?
interactive tasks: logging of messages
terminology: problem -> task ?
writing of verdicts to stdout (include timing and check on interactive tasks, including judge errors)
box: memory usage statistics (need to search for VMPeak in /proc/$PID/status, but it disappears too early)
remove scanning of users by UID

Judges
~~~~~~
clean up exit codes
test cases for judge-shuff

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
fpc: add switch -gl (runtime errors write line#), but avoid that when inside the sandbox

Installer:
- update group permissions
- quotas

New submitter:
- contest: task status cache

Various ideas:
scores dependent on time (like PL olympiad)
box: configurable access to timers and /proc/self/{stat,fd}
box: limit the total amount of data written to files, so that quotas don't have to be set up

TomGav
~~~~~~

recursive try-ln for dir input
clean and well-defined expansion (beware of per-test re-expansion)
machine-readable log file and/or metadata output from the sandbox
configurable names of in/out files (independent of $PROBLEM)
paranoidly check file mode/owner before running the sandbox
