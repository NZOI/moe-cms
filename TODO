Evaluator
~~~~~~~~~
score: better formatting of the score table
interactive tasks: solve deadlocks?
interactive tasks: logging of messages
terminology: problem -> task ?
writing of verdicts to stdout (include timing and check on interactive tasks, including judge errors)
box: memory usage statistics (need to search for VMPeak in /proc/$PID/status, but it disappears too early)

Judges
~~~~~~
integrate to the top-level makefile
clean up exit codes

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
fpc: add switch -gl (runtime errors write line#), but avoid that when inside the sandbox

Installer:
- mo-install: reduce what gets copied to mo-eval home
- update group permissions
- quotas

New submitter:
- contest: task status cache

Various ideas:
scores dependent on time (like PL olympiad)
box: configurable access to timers and /proc/self/{stat,fd}
box: limit the total amount of data written to files, so that quotas don't have to be set up
