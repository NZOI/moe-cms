Evaluator
~~~~~~~~~
score: better formatting of the score table
interactive tasks: solve deadlocks?
interactive tasks: logging of messages
terminology: problem -> task ?
submit, check: unify command-line arguments
writing of verdicts to stdout (include timing and check on interactive tasks, including judge errors)
box: memory usage statistics (need to search for VMPeak in /proc/$PID/status, but it disappears too early)
check: rename `log' ?

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
fpc: add switch -gl (runtime errors write line#)

Installer:
- mo-install: reduce what gets copied to mo-eval home
- update group permissions
- fix makefiles, so that submit/Makefile gets called
- quotas

New submitter:
- Checking of contest time (and per-contestant exceptions)
- Keeping history and pruning status files
- Remember hashes
- multiple IP ranges per Access rule
- contest: override failed check
- contest: local history
- contest: task status cache
- utilitka, kterou si po soutezi mohou vsichni pretestovat na souteznich datech
- per-task setting of maximum submission size

Various ideas:
scores dependent on time (like PL olympiad)
box: konfigurovatelny pristup k timerum a /proc/self/stat (pripadne /proc/self/fd)
