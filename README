How to set up the evaluator:
----------------------------

Edit `config', especially MO_ROOT, EVAL_USER, EVAL_GROUP, TEST_USERS, CT_UID_MIN and CT_UID_MAX.

Create $MO_ROOT  (here we assume it's /aux/mo)

Create the evaluation users (outside $CT_UID_MIN .. $CT_UID_MAX):

	mo-eval:x:65000:65000:MO Evaluator:/aux/mo/eval/mo-eval:/bin/bash
	mo-test1:x:65001:65000:MO Tester 1:/aux/mo/eval/mo-test1:/bin/bash
	mo-test2:x:65002:65000:MO Tester 2:/aux/mo/eval/mo-test2:/bin/bash

Create the evaluation group:

	mo-eval:x:65000:

Create the contestant users (inside $CT_UID_MIN .. $CT_UID_MAX; as many as you wish;
the names don't matter):

	mo00:x:65100:65100:MO Contestant 00:/aux/mo/users/mo00/mo00:/bin/bash
	...
	mo99:x:65199:65199:MO Contestant 99:/aux/mo/users/mo99/mo99:/bin/bash

... and their groups (preferably with the same ID's):

	mo00:x:65100:
	...
	mo99:x:65199:

... and their passwords ...

Run bin/mo-install to create the infrastructure.

Run bin/mo-create-contestants to create contestants' home directories,
files from template/* will be copied there automatically.

If users are logging in remotely, set quotas and other limits for them.
Don't use limits.conf for that since with sshd the limits would affect _root_
(probably bug in interface between sshd and PAM). Just add to /etc/profile:

	if [ $UID -ge 65100 -a $UID -le 65199 ] ; then
		ulimit -Sc 8192		# core file size
		ulimit -SHu 32		# processes
		ulimit -SHn 256		# max open files
		ulimit -SHv 262144	# max virtual memory
	fi


Various notes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- if you want to assign partial score to testcases, just make the OUTPUT_CHECK
  program generate a file $TDIR/$TEST.pts containing the score.
