** How to compile the submission system **

First, unpack holmes-libs-3.12, configure it and run make. You can build a thinner
version with `./configure default.cfg -CONFIG_IMAGES -CONFIG_UCW_THREADS'.

Then uncomment the "SUBMIT" line in the top-level Makefile and let LIBUCW
point to the compiled Holmes libraries.
